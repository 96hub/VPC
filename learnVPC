Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

A secured, isolated network segment hosted within AWS.
Allow us to isolate resources from other resources in the cloud.
We decide what devices are allowed to talk to what other devices in our AWS account.
We get to decide:
a) Subnetting (IP address): specify the IP address to be used in cloud.
b) Routing (Route tables): where and what path packets take as they traverse through the aws acc.
c) Firewalls (NACLS and Security groups): what type of traffic we allow in and out of our env. and to our individual resources.
d) Gateways: customize traffic that goes in and out of our VPC.
*VPCs are specific to a single region.*
*VPCs acts as an network boundary* ie. we need to explicitly allow the two VPCs to communicate.
CIDR Block (Classless Inter-Domain Routing):
     >Every VPC has a range of IP addressses assigned to it called the CIDR block.
     >CIDR block defines the IP addresses that resources in the VPC can use.
     >CIDR block size can be anywhere from /16 to /28
